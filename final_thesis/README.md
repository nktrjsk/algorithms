# Practical part of my final thesis

## About

This code is a part of my final thesis, which is dedicated to the history of the
cryptography. It consists of five implementations, which are:

- Caesar cipher
- Keyed Caesar cipher
- Railfence cipher
- AES
- RSA

I've written these implementations from schemes and instructions except of
constants.

## Notes

Although I tried before, the implementations have some design flaws
(for example, the code is not commented for the most part), which I will fix later.
